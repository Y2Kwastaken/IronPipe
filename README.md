# IronPipe

The goal of IronPipe is to reinforce Spigot API with API improvements in some facets. IronPipe is not
another spigot Fork, but instead a collection of methods that use NMS to be used alongside spigot.
IronPipe is not a 100% solution, however, some things can be remedied externally. Everything in IronPipe has already
been pull requested to spigot and may eventually be replaced.
